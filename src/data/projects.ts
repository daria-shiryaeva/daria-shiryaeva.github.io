    overview: 'I helped develop ten route-wide design principles to guide assets from viaducts to headhouses across the Oxford–Cambridge route.',
    contributions: 'I conducted extensive site analysis of major assets along the route, evaluating their constraints, opportunities, and context. I compiled findings into a cohesive report and coordinated the main project document, developing its structure and integrating feedback from directors, clients, stakeholders, and senior architects. I also updated accompanying sketches and technical drawings to align with the latest design requirements.',
    sustainability: 'The principles embed environmental responsibility and carbon consciousness at their core, ensuring every asset type considers lifecycle impact, climate resilience, and biodiversity connectivity. We prioritized passive-first strategies and material clarity across the entire route.',
    outcomes: 'The ten principles now form the foundation of East West Rail design approach, ensuring consistency and quality across hundreds of assets. The framework supports multi-stakeholder decision-making and sets a new benchmark for large-scale infrastructure design in the UK.',
