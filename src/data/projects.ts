    overview: 'A community-centred sports and wellbeing hub with pools, flexible sports hall and market space, studio and therapy rooms, and generous glazing that connects activity to the street.',
    contributions: 'I designed the full scheme from concept to detail, integrating a complex mixed-use programme that includes adult and children pool depths, a sports hall that converts to market space, café, community rooms, yoga and pilates studios, and therapy spaces. I developed a clear hierarchy of large volumes and cellular spaces, ensuring intuitive circulation and strong connections to the street.',
